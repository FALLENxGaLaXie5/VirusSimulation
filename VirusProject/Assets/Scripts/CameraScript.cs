        Purpose: Update is called at the beginning of every frame at run time.
        This means that all runnable code is ran at one point or another from here.
        Similar to main or runnable with frame by frame implementation.
        Update will change the camera's position to reflect the player's position
            WITHOUT reflecting the player's rotation and MAINTAINING a constant z offset.
